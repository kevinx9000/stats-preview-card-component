## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried using a mobile-first workflow; still having trouble with that as it feels like going in reverse to me. 
I had some difficulty using the HTML `<picture>` tag for the first time, especially when it came to implementing the purple overlay on the image. But I used the `<picture>` tag because two separate images were provided for the mobile/desktop layout.
I still need to work on wrapping sections correctly; I think I should have made a `card-top` and `card-bottom` section, and **then** created a `div` for the underlying text; it might have helped with my alignment and sizing.

### Continued development

Need to work on responsive layouts some more.
Need to work with the picture element and overlays some more.
Need to learn use CSS Grid so that I'm not overly reliant on Flexbox; learn how to integrate the two methods.
